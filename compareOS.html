        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and
          computer hardware. An operating system is software which performs all
          the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process
          management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral
          devices such as disk drives and printers. We are going to look at the
          difference between the big three operating systems, namely, Windows,
          MacOS and Linux.
        </p>
        <h3>Use and cost</h3>
        <p>
          Let's start with the key questions I ask when anyone comes to me for
          advice about computer purchasing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What do you want to do with it?</li>
          <li>How much do you want to spend?</li>
          <li>Which of those two (use versus spend) is more important?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Windows typically comes with new PCs. If you have an old PC, it almost
          certainly comes with Windows. Pretty much the only time you're going
          to pay to buy Windows is if you're building one of your own, and we'll
          address that later. Macs always come with MacOS, so there's no cost
          there. And, of course, Linux is free. The much bigger cost for all
          these environments will be your ongoing maintenance expenses.
        </p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="media/os-cost-catoon.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>
          If you have a budget and require a fast-blazing machine, MacOS is your
          best option. For limited budget and simple interface, i would suggest
          windows and lastly for free open-source OS but with complexity, use
          Linux. As simple as that, you have made your choice.

        <h2>Windows</h2>
        <h4>Directory Structure</h4>
        <p>
          The Windows OS often uses the C drive as the main drive of the
          computer. Every folder, file and programs are stored inside this
          drive, and the terminal may look like this <b>C:\></b>. A user folder
          is created inside the C drive, meaning every user will have its own
          directories. Windows also uses backslashes compared to other operating
          systems.
        </p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="media/cmd.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <h4>Naming Convention</h4>
        <p>
          All file systems follow the same general naming conventions for an
          individual file: a base file name and an optional extension, separated
          by a period. However, each file system, such as NTFS, CDFS, exFAT,
          UDFS, FAT, and FAT32, can have specific and differing rules about the
          formation of the individual components in the path to a directory or
          file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following fundamental rules enable applications to create and
          process valid names for files and directories, regardless of the file
          system:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use a period to separate the base file name from the extension in
            the name of a directory or file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a backslash (\) to separate the components of a path, for
            example C:\.Does not assume case sensitivity. Oscar and OSCAR are
            not the same.
          </li>
          <li>
            Files have a maximum length limit. Cannot have a long-named file.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="linux">
        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <h4>Directory Structure</h4>
        <p>
          Linux has the most complex file system and command interface. Just
          like Windows, Linux creates it own main drive, they call it the root
          directory. All the files and folders are stored in this directory.
          What makes the file system even more complex is that Linux has
          different distributions including Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat and
          many others. You have to adapt to the structure based on what you
          choose. Uses foward-slash implementation just like root:/
        </p>
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="media/ubuntu.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <h4>Naming Convention</h4>
        <p>
          Linux file systems (such as ext4, Btrfs, XFS, etc.) follow
          POSIX-compliant naming and path conventions. These rules apply across
          most Linux distributions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a forward slash / to separate components in a path.</li>
          <li>
            No drive letters — Linux uses a single hierarchical file system tree
            rooted at /.
          </li>
          <li>
            Case-sensitive: File.txt, file.txt, and FILE.TXT are three different
            files.
          </li>
          <li>
            File extensions are optional and not required by the system. A file
            is identified by its content or permissions, not the extension.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hidden files or directories begin with a dot. (e.g., .bashrc,
            .config).
          </li>
          <li>
            There are no restrictions on length in most modern file systems
            (usually up to 255 characters for file names).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="macos">
        <h2>MacOS</h2>
        <h4>Directory Structure</h4>
        <p>
          The macOS file structure is UNIX based operating system. Unlike
          Windows, macOS does not use drive letters; instead, all files and
          folders exist within this unified structure. The main user-facing
          directory is located at /Users, where each user has their own folder
          (e.g., /Users/alex). This is equivalent to the C:\Users\ directory in
          Windows. The macOS terminal typically starts in the user’s home
          directory and might look like this: alex@MacBook ~ %. macOS uses
          forward slashes (/) to separate path components, consistent with UNIX
          conventions. Mounted drives and external volumes appear under the
          /Volumes directory rather than having individual drive letters like
          C:\ or D:\. System files and applications are stored in directories
          like /System, /Library, and /Applications.
        </p>

          <img src="media/zsh.webp" alt="" />
        </div>
        <h4>Naming Convention</h4>
        <p>
          macOS uses Apple File System and supports HFS+. It follows similar
          UNIX-style naming conventions but with a few Mac-specific behaviors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a forward slash / to separate path components.</li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Case-insensitive by default on APFS and HFS+ volumes, but this can
              vary:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                file.txt and File.txt are the same file on default
                installations.
              </li>
              <li>Developers can format volumes to be case-sensitive.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            File extensions are optional and not required. The system may use
            metadata to identify file types (like MIME types or Uniform Type
            Identifiers).
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>File names can include almost any character, except:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Colon: (used internally by macOS)</li>
              <li>Null character \0</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Slashes / are reserved as path separators, so they cannot be used in
            file names.
          </li>
        </ul>

          There are many other differences between these operating systems in
          regard to how they operate and take commands. These are some of the
          missing differences between Windows, MacOS and Linux which might be
          helpful when trying to identify the machine’s operating system.

          As mentioned before, it really depends on your budget, computing needs
          and many more. Match your needs and choose the best operating system
          based on your needs and what you can afford, they are more or less the
          same, they all compute, do arithmetics and display the output.
