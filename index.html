        <p>
          Africa's tech industry is rapidly growing with digital innovation,
          startups, and large scale IT projects all across the continent. Behind
          this growth lies a unique set of challanges faced by IT professionals
          in Africa. As IT professionals, we have to go through alot from budget
          to leadership support, these are 11 challanges faced by IT
          professionals in Africa:

        <div class="content">
          Often times, you find people complaining about the workload they get
          but the is it really about the amount of work assigned? IT
          professionals struggle to do their work due to the lack of skills
          required to do the job. Their organizations do not provide the
          necessary training to do the work, so they get overwhelmed by the
          workload and become stressed about their jobs.
          <br /><br />
          Over half of the organizations do not offer training to their
          employees. They will outsource for skills and talent rather than
          developing their staff to become expertise at that certain role.

        <div id="cybersecurity" class="point">2. Cybersecurity</div>
        <div class="content">
          Most IT profesionals lack cybersecurity expertise. Cybersecurity is
          not prioritized as a threat in most african countries as they often
          get fewer cybersecurity attacks compared to Europe, China, United
          States and other nations. More and more huge coperations suffer from
          data breach, which shows how much of a problem it is. Decision-makers
          need to assess this issue and consider the security risk they may be
          putting their company under if there are few security measures in
          place.
          <br /><br />
          IT profesionals need to be trained to specialize in cybersecurity for
          assurance and security. Very few africans are specialising in
          cybersecurity compared to the mass population in the IT industry.

        <div class="content">
          Many IT professionals may specialise in a certain sector in IT, be it
          Design, Programming, Testing, etc. This means in some areas there are
          gaps that need to be filled and when the organization does not have
          people with a certain skill, it becomes a problem. They end up
          recruiting more people to help specialize in that skill. Managers need
          to realise that technology changes and traditional methods will soon
          be replaced. Meaning employees need to be upskilled for the future.

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          As mentioned above, traditional methods are getting less use in morden
          society. Digital Transformation should be equals to skills
          transformation. This means, there needs to be changes introduced.
          Decision-makers should be open to training the staff to adapt to the
          transformation. With introduction to many technologies including AI,
          DevOps, Cloud computing etc, proper training is necessary.

        <div id="cloud-computing" class="point">5. Cloud Computing</div>
        <div class="content">
          Among other technologies, Cloud computing has proven to be more in
          demand for organizations looking to scale their businesses together
          with Big Data. There are very few cloud enginners available in the
          industry.

        <div class="content">
          Unemployment continues to rise although IT jobs also rise in demand.
          Managers tend to recruit few people to do the work. This increases the
          staff workload and constantly work under pressure. This is a concern
          especially to the youth with skills.

      <div class="block">
        <div id="budget" class="point">7. Budget</div>
        <div class="content">
          Most Entreprenuers in Africa know that budget is the most constraining
          factor in a business. Many Many IT Projects are running with a low
          budget which is both a financial and business risk. Budget tend to
          produce quality projects because there was alot of investment done on
          a project. Low budget means we have to get the cheapest IT
          professionals which may lack the skills required, poor skills will
          deliver poor quality.

        <div id="leadership-support" class="point">8. Leadership Support</div>
        <div class="content">
          Lack of support and understanding from organisational leadership can
          undermine IT initiatives. Leadership may have the budget for training
          the staff but not use it. Lack of support can lead to IT staff leaving
          because they do not get any motivation and growth for the work they
          are doing.

      <div class="block">
        <div id="automation" class="point">9. Automation</div>
        <div class="content">
          Ever since automation was introduced, workers fear for their jobs. In
          recent years, especially during Covid, IT profesionals were deeply
          concerned about being replaced by automation and robotics. This also
          started a huge argument on whether Artificial Inteligence can replace
          IT staff or not. Jobs are at risk as technology emergies day by day.

      <div class="block">
        <div id="project-management" class="point">10. Project Management</div>
        <div class="content">
          IT companies fail to realise that project management is the most
          important aspect when developing a project. There are few project
          managers in organisations are many are not aware of the importance of
          project planning and project management. These so called 'project
          managers' take your project from start to finish, from planning to
          deploying phase. They also assess the risk, cost, estimations even
          before the project start. Without a project manager the business is
          deemed to failure or uncertancy with delays or even scope creep.

      <div class="block">
        <div id="career-growth" class="point">11. Career Growth</div>
        <div class="content">
          IT profesionals are reported to leave their jobs to persure another
          job or the same exact job for only one reason, and that is career
          growth. If the organisation is sturbon to change and resist training
          their staff, leaving the job is the only option. Both intrinsic and
          extrinsic rewards can show how much you value your people so they can
          get motivation to do the job. Mentorship and structured pathway can
          help play a role in career growth, especially to the youth.
